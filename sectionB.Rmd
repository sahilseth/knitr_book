## section B 1

- At times I like to be stand alone document, with three sections.
- When included in master, my sections should really be sub-sections; help please?


## section B 2


```{r }
summary(cars)
```

## section B 3

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
