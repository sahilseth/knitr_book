title: "Section A"

This is a markdown document with two sections. The master.pdf should have 


```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## section A 1

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
